# JavaScript Validation

This folder contains JavaScript validation notes, screenshots, and decisions.

## Tools

- JSHint/JSLint/ESLint (as available)
- Browser console for runtime errors

## Current Status

- Known linter warnings for ES6 features are acceptable per project policy.
- Real errors (undefined variables, syntax issues) must be fixed.

## Screenshots

## Code Style Decision (summary)

This project keeps its current JavaScript style for now and modernizes gradually. See the root README for full reasoning.
