# Style.css Validation

## Before and After

When I first checked style.css with the W3C validator:

- 2 errors
- 84 warnings

After I fixed the problems:

- 0 errors
- 84 warnings (these are okay)

## What I Fixed

1. **Line 443**: In `.features-section`
   - Problem: `contain-intrinsic-size: 600px 400px;` isn't standard CSS
   - Fix: Changed to `min-height: 600px;` which works in all browsers

2. **Line 1018**: In `.product-info .notes`
   - Problem: `line-clamp: 2;` isn't standard CSS
   - Fix: Removed this line (kept the `-webkit-line-clamp` which works)

## About The Warnings

Most warnings are for:

- CSS variables (like --color-primary)
- Browser code (-webkit prefixes)
- Empty rules
- Color issues

These don't hurt the website. Some are even needed for the site to work properly.
