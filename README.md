## ÔøΩ Agile Development

This project was developed using Agile methodology with continuous iteration and user feedback integration.

### Project Management

- **GitHub Project Board**: [View Project Board](https://github.com/users/iismail06/projects/5/views/1)
- **Board Visibility**: Set to public for transparency and collaboration
- **Workflow Columns**: Backlog ‚Üí Todo ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done

### User Story Mapping

All user stories from the above section have been mapped to the GitHub project board as individual issues/items:

- ‚úÖ **First-time visitor stories** - Mapped to onboarding and homepage features
- ‚úÖ **Registered user stories** - Mapped to core CRUD functionality
- ‚úÖ **Returning user stories** - Mapped to dashboard and progress tracking features

### Development Task Breakdown

Each user story has been broken down into specific development tasks:

- Database model design and implementation
- View and URL configuration
- Template creation and styling
- Form handling and validation
- Authentication and authorization
- API integration and testing

### Prioritization System (MoSCoW)

Features were prioritized using the MoSCoW method:

- **Must Have**: User authentication, basic CRUD operations, responsive design
- **Should Have**: Product search, routine tracking, user profiles
- **Could Have**: Progress analytics, social features, API integrations
- **Won't Have**: Advanced AI recommendations, mobile app (for this iteration)
