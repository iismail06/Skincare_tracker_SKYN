### Code Validation

All code in the project was validated using appropriate validation tools:

#### HTML Validation

HTML templates were validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

| Page | Status | Issues Found | Resolution |
|------|--------|--------------|------------|
| Base Template | ❌ → ✅ | Unnecessary resource hints and trailing slashes on void elements | Simplified head (removed hints) and fixed void element syntax |
| Home Page | ❌ → ✅ | Trailing slashes on img elements, improper attribute values | Removed trailing slashes, corrected attribute values |
| Product Form | ❌ → ✅ | Incorrect use of placeholder attribute on date inputs, aria-describedby attributes without targets | Fixed attribute usage, connected aria attributes to proper targets |
| Add Routine | ❌ → ✅ | Value of 'for' attributes not matching ID of form controls, improper label associations | Connected labels to form controls with proper IDs |
| Profile Questionnaire | ❌ → ✅ | aria-describedby attributes without corresponding elements, incorrect form structure | Added proper help text elements, fixed form structure |
| My Routines | ❌ → ✅ | Possible misuse of aria-label attributes, empty action attributes on forms | Fixed ARIA attributes, added proper action URLs to forms |
| Cookie Consent | ❌ → ✅ | Incorrectly injected HTML via middleware | Fixed HTML structure in middleware |

For detailed information and screenshots of the validation results, see the [HTML validation documentation](documentation/validation/html/README.md).

#### Python Validation

Python code was validated using flake8. Results and screenshots are organized per app (Users, Routines, Products) to mirror the HTML validation style.

- Overview: [Python validation index](documentation/validation/python/README.md)
- Users app: [Users Python validation](documentation/validation/python/users/README.md)
- Routines app: [Routines Python validation](documentation/validation/python/routines/README.md)
- Products app: [Products Python validation](documentation/validation/python/products/README.md)

Add your screenshots into the corresponding `errors/` and `passes/` folders and link them in the tables.

##### Code Cleanup and PEP8 Compliance (Oct 13, 2025)

All Python files were cleaned and formatted to follow PEP8 style guidelines for better readability and maintainability.

- ✅ Line length fixed: All lines were shortened to stay under 79 characters (E501 errors resolved).
- ✅ Indentation corrected: Adjusted over-indented continuation lines (E127 errors fixed).
- ✅ Blank lines standardized: Improved spacing for functions and imports.
- ✅ Consistency ensured: Cleaned up long function calls and improved readability without changing functionality.
- ✅ Token and syntax issues resolved: Fixed any accidental formatting or token errors during cleanup.

#### CSS Validation

CSS files were validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

| File | Status | Issues Found | Resolution |
|------|--------|--------------|------------|
| style.css | ❌ → ✅ | 2 errors with `contain-intrinsic-size` and `line-clamp` properties, 84 warnings | Replaced non-standard properties with standards-compliant alternatives or proper vendor prefixes, added documentation for warnings |
| dashboard_style.css | ⚠️ | No errors, warnings for CSS variables and vendor prefixes | No action needed - warnings are related to modern CSS features |

**Note about warnings**: The CSS validator shows warnings for modern CSS features like CSS variables and vendor prefixes, which are necessary for cross-browser compatibility and are considered best practices. These warnings do not affect functionality.

For detailed information about the validation results and our approach to handling the warnings, see the [CSS validation documentation](documentation/validation/css/style-css-validation.md).

### CSS Validation Fixes (October 2025)

- **Fixed CSS validation error with text truncation**: Replaced non-standard `-webkit-line-clamp` approach with standard CSS properties (`max-height`, `overflow: hidden`, and `text-overflow: ellipsis`). This improved W3C validation compliance while maintaining the same visual appearance of truncated text.
- **Updated code documentation**: Clarified our approach to text truncation in code comments, now explicitly stating we use standard CSS properties instead of vendor-prefixed ones to ensure better compatibility and validation.
For detailed information about validation fixes, see [CSS Validation Documentation](documentation/validation/css/style-css-validation.md).

## Code Style Decision

This project keeps its current JavaScript style for now instead of converting everything to ES6+ or changing the linter rules.

Why:

- The code works as-is, and a full rewrite could cause regressions.
- We want to modernize gradually, not all at once.
- Some environments may still expect this syntax.

What this means:

- You’ll see linter warnings about const, let, arrow functions, and other ES6 features — these are expected and not blockers.
- Do fix real runtime or syntax errors (undefined variables, missing semicolons, etc.).
- Avoid large style-only PRs. When you do update a file, keep changes small and test them.

Future plans:

- We’ll modernize code and update the linter gradually, focusing first on correctness and tests.
- If you want to propose a full upgrade, open an issue or RFC with a clear migration plan.

SKYN was tested across the following browsers to ensure consistent performance:

| Browser | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Google Chrome | ✅ Fully Functional |
| Mozilla Firefox | ✅ Fully Functional |
| Microsoft Edge | ✅ Fully Functional |
| Safari (Mac) | ✅ Fully Functional |
| Mobile Safari (iOS) | ✅ Fully Functional |

### Bugs and Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix | Date | Status  |
|-------|--------|-----|------|--------|
| Routine progress not saving | Missing field in form submission | Added correct form field mapping | Fixed | — |
| Calendar not updating | JavaScript event not triggering | Added event listener for date selection | Fixed | — |

| Product browsing endpoint mismatch | Frontend and backend URLs out of sync | Updated main.js and api_urls.py to correct browse endpoints  | Fixed | — |
| Edit buttons not responding | Non-delegated events and missing data attrs | Switched to data attributes and delegated event listeners | Fixed | — |
| JS errors due to script order | Scripts executed before dependencies | Reordered script tags for proper execution | Fixed | — |
| TemplateSyntaxError in home.html | {% extends %} not first line | Moved extends to be the first tag in template | Fixed | — |
| 500 errors in production | Strict SSL redirect, static config, hosts | Disabled premature SSL redirect, added WhiteNoise, expanded hosts, added logging | Fixed | — |
| Models/views broken after restore | Incorrect module references and incomplete queries | Replaced routines.models and completed querysets; sanity check passed | Fixed | — |

#### Bug: Favorite toggle control

- Status: Fixed (UX)
- Severity: Low
- Affected area: Product form (favorite checkbox)

Summary: Users reported clicking “Mark as Favorite” didn’t seem to do anything. Functionally it worked, but the tiny native checkbox and separated label made the change easy to miss.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Open Add/Edit Product
2) Click the “Mark as Favorite” label
3) Observe minimal visual feedback with the native checkbox

Root cause: Small native checkbox and label on separate line reduced perceived interactivity.

Fix implemented:

- Made the entire label clickable and visually hid the native checkbox
- Added star icon + accent color + bold when checked for clear feedback
- Preserved accessibility: native input remains labeled and focusable

Verification:

- Toggling works via click and keyboard focus
- State persists on form save

## Known limitations

### 10‑step Routine Builder for non‑daily categories

Context: The Add Routine form (templates/routines/add_routine.html) is designed with up to 10 step slots and matching optional product links (routines/forms.py defines step1–step10 and product1–product10). This works well for daily AM/PM skincare flows where a longer sequence is common.

What you’ll see:

- For some categories, you may only need a few steps, so many of the 10 slots will remain blank.
- The suggestions pool can be smaller for these categories, so the product dropdowns may feel sparse.

Affected routine types:

- Body care
- Hair care
- Special treatment (one‑off or occasional routines)
- Seasonal treatment
- Monthly routines

Impact on users:

- The form can look a bit “empty,” but this is not an error. You can submit with only the steps you need; blanks are expected and supported.
- Tracking, dashboard display, and completion logic still work as long as at least one step is provided (the form enforces “at least one step”).

Why it happens:

- The UI exposes a fixed 10‑step layout to keep the form simple and consistent across routine types. Some categories naturally have fewer actionable steps and fewer suggested products, so you won’t fill all slots.

Recommended workarounds (today):

- Enter only the steps you actually use; leave the rest blank.
- Prefer concise routines for these types (e.g., 2–5 steps for hair/body/special/seasonal/monthly).
- Link a product only when it helps; steps can be tracked without a product selection.
- If you need more context, include details in the step name (e.g., “Scalp serum (monthly)”).

Planned improvements (backlog):

- Dynamic step counts per routine type (e.g., default to 3–5 for hair/body/special/seasonal/monthly).
- Progressive disclosure (show 3 steps by default with “Add another step” up to a sensible cap).
- Category‑specific templates/presets and better product suggestions for non‑daily flows.
- Optional collapse of unused step fields to reduce visual noise.

Status: Documented as a known limitation. We’re keeping the current builder because it works well for AM/PM and weekly routines; the above improvements will make non‑daily categories feel lighter while preserving consistency.

### Summary

All features passed testing successfully with no critical issues remaining. The site performs well across devices, browsers, and screen sizes.

---

## Performance notes (concise)

- Static files via WhiteNoise (hashed filenames, gzip/brotli).
- Images via Cloudinary (f_auto, q_auto).
- Deterministic order: Bootstrap CSS → app CSS; app JS → Bootstrap JS.
